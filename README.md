# gnn_playground
An ever-growing playground of scripts to showcase GNN's power and might

## Goals
- Implement a simple GCN, GAT models from scratch in PyTorch
- Train these models on a variety of datasets from [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html) and document the results.
- Visualize the learned embeddings in real-time using plotly on a 2D plane. 
- If 2D visualization is not possible, use t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings and visualize them in 2D.

## Ambitious Goals
- Implement GNN dynamics model for common Mujoco robotics environments.
- Do ablation studies to compare common MLP dynamics models with GNN dynamics models.
- Visualize these embeddings in real-time using plotly on a 2D plane too, if possible.
